## Machine Learning Paradigm Overview
### Age and Income
* mathematics used will be similar to those training language models
* learning how to fit a univariate curve
* option instead of a parabola in this case could be a Sigmordal function with a number line
* question is whether or not the data points are stochastic models
* know if deviation in the curve is a "real" effect or statistical effect, to know this you must get more data
* if you get better statistical noise, there will be less variation
### Data Generated Function: Ground Truth 
* a parabola would be the ground truth functional form for a regression
* Data Provenance: tracing data origin, transformations, and changes. Ensures accountability, reliability, and quality in data-driven processes and decisions
* Neural networks tend to entropolate (not fit the data well)
* you need mathematical modeling not curve fitting
* Understand fundamental property of nature
* Good data captures aspects of the ground truth
* Good labeled data is a representation of the ground truth
### Regression Tasks
#### Scalar Regression (or curve fitting)
* intercept, fitting parameter for x1 and x2
* x is a vector and a parameterization
* scalar regression is learning a plane in two dimensions
